# Security Documentation

This directory contains security documentation for the Keystone Security Platform.

## Security Model Overview

Keystone implements a comprehensive security model focused on:

- **Vulnerability Detection**: Multi-scanner approach for comprehensive coverage
- **Supply Chain Security**: SBOM generation and artifact attestation
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated security policy evaluation
- **Secure Development**: DevSecOps integration and workflow automation

## Current Security Implementation

### Vulnerability Scanning

**Multi-Scanner Integration**:
- **Trivy**: Container, filesystem, and dependency vulnerability detection
- **Grype**: Package-focused vulnerability analysis
- **Correlation**: Framework for comparing and merging scanner findings

**Security Coverage**:
- CVE detection across Go dependencies
- Severity-based vulnerability classification
- JSON output for programmatic analysis
- Integration with vulnerability databases

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

**SBOM Generation**:
- **SPDX Format**: Industry-standard software bill of materials
- **CycloneDX Format**: Component analysis and vulnerability correlation
- **Comprehensive Cataloging**: Dependencies, licenses, and relationships

**Supply Chain Security**:
- Dependency transparency and tracking
- License compliance verification
- Artifact integrity through checksums
- Secure storage in GitHub Container Registry

### GitHub Actions Security Pipeline

**Automated Security Workflows**:
- Event-driven scanning (push, PR, release)
- Parallel scanner execution for efficiency
- Secure artifact storage and management
- Workflow-based policy enforcement

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

**Assets Protected**:
- Source code repositories
- Application dependencies
- Build artifacts and containers
- Security scan results and SBOMs

**Threats Addressed**:
- Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Supply chain attacks
- Malicious code injection
- Credential exposure

**Security Controls**:
- Automated vulnerability detection
- Dependency transparency through SBOMs
- Secure artifact storage
- Audit logging and traceability

## Security Best Practices

### Development Security

**Secure Coding Practices**:
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- SBOM generation for transparency
- Security policy enforcement

**Local Development Security**:
- Secure tool installation via Homebrew
- GitHub CLI authentication
- Container runtime isolation with Colima
- Local secret management

### CI/CD Security

**Pipeline Security**:
- Isolated execution environments
- Secure secret handling
- Artifact signing (planned)
- Audit logging and monitoring

**Access Control**:
- GitHub Actions permissions
- Repository access controls
- Artifact storage security
- Workflow approval requirements

## Compliance Framework

### Industry Standards

**SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts)**:
- Source integrity verification
- Build process security
- Artifact provenance tracking
- Distribution security

**NIST Secure Software Development Framework**:
- Secure development practices
- Vulnerability management
- Supply chain risk management
- Security testing integration

### Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Requirement | Keystone Implementation |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| SLSA Level 1 | Version control | GitHub repository with audit logs |
| SLSA Level 2 | Build service | GitHub Actions with defined workflows |
| SLSA Level 3 | Build isolation | Containerized build environments |
| NIST SSDF | Vulnerability Detection | Trivy and Grype integration |
| NIST SSDF | Dependency Management | SBOM generation with Syft |

## Security Monitoring

### Current Monitoring

**Vulnerability Tracking**:
- Automated vulnerability detection
- Severity classification and reporting
- Trend analysis across scanner results
- Integration with GitHub Security Advisory

**Audit Logging**:
- GitHub Actions workflow execution logs
- Scanner execution and results
- Artifact storage and access logs
- Authentication and authorization events

### Planned Security Monitoring

**Real-time Security Dashboard**:
- Live vulnerability status
- Security metrics and trends
- Policy compliance monitoring
- Incident response integration

**Advanced Threat Detection**:
- Anomaly detection in scan results
- Supply chain attack indicators
- Policy violation alerts
- Automated response workflows

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Categories

**Vulnerability Incidents**:
- Critical vulnerability detection
- Zero-day vulnerability disclosure
- Dependency compromise
- Supply chain attacks

**Operational Incidents**:
- Scanner failures or compromises
- Workflow security breaches
- Credential exposure
- Unauthorized access

### Response Procedures

**Immediate Response**:
1. Assess vulnerability impact and scope
2. Implement temporary mitigations
3. Notify stakeholders and security team
4. Document incident details and timeline

**Investigation and Remediation**:
1. Conduct root cause analysis
2. Implement permanent fixes
3. Update security policies and procedures
4. Conduct post-incident review

## Security Documentation (Future)
